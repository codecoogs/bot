Code Coogs Discord Rules
=============================================================

01 | Be respectful, civil, and welcoming.

02 | No inappropriate or unsafe content.

03 | Do not misuse or spam in any of the channels.

04 | Any content that is NSFW is not allowed under any circumstances.

05 | Discord names and avatars must be appropriate.

06 | Anything to target specific groups/individuals is prohibited.

07 | Do not record voice channel conversations.

08 | Discriminatory language and hate speech is forbidden.

09 | Bullying and harassment is not tolerated.

10 | Trolling will not be tolerated.

=============================================================

You will be given 2 warnings and kicked on the 3rd.
To get back into the server, you will have to write a one-page essay on why you should be admitted back, 
and my officer team will decide if to admit you or not. 
But that is only if you do not want to wait a year. After a year, you can join back without writing the essay.

The essay is optional if you do not want to wait a year.
This is not a joke.
This is not bluff.
You will be kicked.
ALL you have to do is follow the rules.
Simplicity.

React to gain access to other channels.
